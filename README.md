## Experimental Environment

All experiments were implemented in **PyTorch 1.12.0** and executed on a single **NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU**.  
Our framework builds on two pre-trained components:
- **OWLv2-base-patch16** weights for open-vocabulary object detection.  
- **SAM-L (ViT-L)** checkpoint for mask generation.
